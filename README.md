### Learning Haskell

I want to learn more about how functional programming is done, so what better way than to try out a purely functional language :)


## Projects

### [FizzBuzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz)

Classic first project when learning a new language

"Count incrementally from 1, replacing any number divisible by three with the word "fizz", and any number divisible by five with the word "buzz", and any number divisible by both three and five with the word 'fizzbuzz'"


### [Collatz conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture)

I thought this problem was interesting, and I wanted to try out some typical recursion problem. The functions returns how many steps n is needed to reach 1 


"Select an arbitrary positive integer, then:
- If the number is even, divide it by two.
- If the number is odd, triple it and add one.

This process will eventually reach the number 1, regardless of which positive integer is chosen initially"

### Utils

This was the first function I wrote in haskell, it's just a simple startsWith check. I really like the pattern matching for function definitions
